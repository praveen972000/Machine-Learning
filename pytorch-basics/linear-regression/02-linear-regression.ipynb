    "#### Part 2 of \"PyTorch: Zero to GANs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*This post is the second in a series of tutorials on building deep learning models with PyTorch, an open source neural networks library developed and maintained by Facebook. Check out the full series:*\n",

    "Continuing where the [previous tutorial](https://jvn.io/aakashns/3143ceb92b4f4cbbb4f30e203580b77b) left off, we'll discuss one of the foundational  algorithms of machine learning in this post: *Linear regression*. We'll create a model that predicts crop yields for apples and oranges (*target variables*) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall and humidity (*input variables or features*) in a region. Here's the training data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![linear-regression-training-data](https://i.imgur.com/6Ujttb4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a linear regression model, each target variable is estimated to be a weighted sum of the input variables, offset by some constant, known as a bias :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "yield_apple  = w11 * temp + w12 * rainfall + w13 * humidity + b1\n",
    "yield_orange = w21 * temp + w22 * rainfall + w23 * humidity + b2\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "![linear-regression-graph](https://i.imgur.com/4DJ9f8X.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *learning* part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights `w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2` by looking at the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data (i.e. to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall and humidity). This is done by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called *gradient descent*."
